# Chrome Incognito Cookie Tester

This is a quick test of Google Chrome's Incognito Mode privacy capabilities. Are cookies that are set in normal windows readable by incognito windows?

The answer appears to be that cookies are **not** readable between regular windows and incognito windows. Feel free to create an issue or fork this repo and fix it, if I've missed something.
